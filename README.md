# Credit-Card-Default-Detection

This notebook aims to classify clients of a credit card company based on default. It  is a **Binary Classification Problem** where based on every clients details like History of Past payments, Amount of bill statement, Limit balance thery are classified is they will be in default category or not.
In this notebook i have focused on following parts:
1. Feature understanding based on target variable 
2. Feature Selection
3. Cross Decision Tree algorithm and Cross validation on it.
4. Random Forest and Cross validation.


This notebook has following workflow:

1. Understand, Clean and Format Data (Cleaning data and EDA)

2. Examining the Relationships between Features and the Response (Feature Engineering)
    
    2.1. Feature Selection using F-test
    
    2.2. Fitting model on Features selected using F-test.
