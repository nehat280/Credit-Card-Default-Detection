# Credit-Card-Default-Detection

This notebook aims to classify clients of a credit card company based on default. It  is a **Binary Classification Problem** where based on every clients details like History of Past payments, Amount of bill statement, Limit balance thery are classified is they will be in default category or not.
In this notebook i have focused on following parts:
1. Feature understanding based on target variable 
2. Feature Selection
3. Cross Decision Tree algorithm and Cross validation on it.
4. Random Forest and Cross validation.


This notebook has following workflow:

1. Understand, Clean and Format Data

2. Exploratory Data Analysis 
2.1. Univariate Analysis 2.2. Bivariate Analysis

Training model with all features

Feature Engineering & Selection 4.1 Adding Additional Features

Fitting the Model with best features. 5.1. Decision tree model 5.2. Random Forest Classifier 5.2.1. Hyper Parameter on Random Forest

Visualization of the best model using Confusion Matrix.

Interpret Model Results

Where to Find these Trees?
